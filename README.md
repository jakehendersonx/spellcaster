# spellcaster

A game where you have to write spells to execute them, in C (raylib).

### installation and setup

use the raylib quickstart for this (already done just fyi)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart.git
```

in the base directory

```bash
mv raylib/ spellcaster/
```

```bash
cd spellcaster/build
./premake5.osx gmake2
cd ..
make
```
